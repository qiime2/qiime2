Q2D3
----

This is a prototype that illustrates how to use the QIIME 2 SDK to build an interface. This is based on the earlier [q2d2](https://github.com/gregcaporaso/q2d2) prototype.

As this is a prototype, you shouldn't rely on any of the code in this subpackage. This code will be removed in favor of production-ready interfaces in the near future (see [#32](https://github.com/biocore/qiime2/issues/32)). For a demo of this interface, see the [q2d3-interface-demo](https://github.com/gregcaporaso/q2d3-interface-demo) repository.
